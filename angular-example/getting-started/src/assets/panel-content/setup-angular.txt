## Setting up the angular example

This is a short guide how to run the angular example for lind-rs

### Prerequisites

Prerequisites to run the angular example are node.js, npm and angular-cli.
If you do not have all of them installed, you should do so before proceeding
with following the guide.
Also you need to follow all guides in the panels above this one.

### Clone

After taking care of the prerequisites, you have to clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EgatlovS/lind.git
```


### The angular example

The angular example consists of four parts.
The first part is a `navbar-plugin`, which functions as a npm module.
The three other parts are the angular projects `about`, `getting-started` and
`tutorial`. All of those include the `navbar-plugin` and use it as a navigation bar.
Since `navbar-plugin` is a module included in the other projects and not a project itself,
it does not need to be run.

#### Run the angular-projects

To run the three angular-projects navigate into each project folder e.g. /lind/angular-example/about.
Then run the command `ng serve` in the command line. To view the website look at the ports under which
it runs and enter localhost:{port} in your browser.
