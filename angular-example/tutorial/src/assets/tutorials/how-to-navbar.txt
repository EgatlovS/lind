## How to create your own navbar plugin

#### Key elements
+ A data service
+ A navbar


### Data service
Write a service that can retrieve all linkpoints of a specific structure.
For that you need the id of the structure.
To filter the retrieved linkpoint list you also need to know the field names declared in the structure.

Additionally the service has to be able to retrieve certain fields of a linkpoint. These contain the values
of a linkpoint and will later on be displayed in the navbar.

### Navbar Component
Now you can write your navbar, which is just an ordinary navbar, with the single difference being, that you don't hardwire it's elements.

You retrieve those from the server using the previously written service and list them with an ngFor.
To pass the parameters to the service you can either hardwire them in the navbar component, or pass them to the navbar via @Input


### Combine these two in a npm module
Now you need to combine these two in a npm module so you can use that module in several projects.
To use it in a project create a local_modules folder on the same folder level as node_modules and
run
```
npm install --save local_modules/{plugin_name}
```
This will register the plugin in the package.json file.
