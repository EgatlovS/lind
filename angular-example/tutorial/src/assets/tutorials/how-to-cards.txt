## How to create a card layout
Another example would be creating a card layout which works the same a the navbar-plugin.

#### Key elements
+ A data service
+ A card layout

For the same reason as with the navbar, you need a data service. Just like with the navbar, you also need a html layout
of how your card layout is going to look and be structured.

### The card layout
Write a card layout in whatever form you want (the example on the `about` page uses bootstrap) and then
use the service to get the data you want to display in the card layout.

### After writing the card layout
If you are done writing your layout and it corretly displays the data, you can choose what to do with it.
You could use it only in one of the applications behind the navbar or decide you need that component in several apps and therefore
include it as a module, just like the `navbar-plugin`.
